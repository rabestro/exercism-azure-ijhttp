### Large target values
# This test case checks if the API correctly returns the fewest number of coins for a target of 999 cents.
# The available coins are 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 cents. The expected result is two 2 cent coins, one 5 cent coin, two 20 cent coins, one 50 cent coin, and seven 100 cent coins.
